                        <p>It's time to track this boy down once and for all.</p>
                        <p>And by boy, I mean girl. And by girl, I mean somewhere in the area of 2,000 to 6,000 individuals.</p>
                        <p>If you're anything like me, you might've figured that captial-B-Bigfoot represents a single, elusive and undying cryptid that makes the entirety of the North American woodlands its abode. It eludes capture and documentation not only because of its mystifying, preternatural ways, but also because it kind of doesn't exist.</p>
                        <p>After about a year of listening to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/sasquatch-tracks/id1518903701" target="_">cryptid podcasts</a> to dull the existential pains of working a desk job, though, I learned that there's a dedicated community of actual sasquatch trackers who pursue the legendary creature in much the same way they would any extant species. To them, Bigfoot is like any other animal: Not only does it exist, but it exists in numbers.</p>
                        <p>It's from this community--namely those at the <a href="https://www.bfro.net/" target="_">Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization</a>--that I derived the data I'm using to suss out which state has the most bigfoot sightings, and why. It's a spreadsheet compiled by <a href="https://data.world/timothyrenner/bfro-sightings-data/workspace/file?filename=bfro_reports_geocoded.csv" target="_">Timothy Renner</a> full of sightings reported from 2021 to as early as the 1800s.</p>
                        <p>I have to clarify that, despite what it may seem, I am not a believer. I love the idea of cryptids, but if you ask me, way too much time has passed with way too little evidence to suggest that we're just not looking in the right places. I'm more of a fan of the lore, if that makes sense. It's a fun part of human culture.</p>

                        <p>Still, my goal isn't to run a sardonic expos&eacute; on legitimate sasquatch trackers. There's a story in the data here, and that's all I'm concerned with. What part of the U.S. is responsible for the most bigfoot sightings? <em>Where is Bigfootopia, U.S.A?</em></p>

It's literally as far from the Pacific Northwest as you can get while still being in the contigugous United States. But if I learned anything from this data, it's that the image of Bigfoot manifests in many ways and many places. In Florida, it's associated, if not synonymous, with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skunk_ape" target="_">the skunk ape,</a> which has permeated southeastern culture in much the same way that sasquatch has northwestern culture.</p>

Since when was it a hotbed for cryptid, and otherwise paranormal, activity? Maybe because Ohio sits squarely in land that is historically Iroquois, its share of the sightings could be related to Iroquois stories about the <em>Genoskwa</em>, a creature similar in description to the conventional understanding of a bigfoot.</p>

The best I could muster was an article about <a href="https://www.thrillist.com/travel/nation/willow-creek-california-bigfoot-capital-of-the-world" target="_">Willow Creek,</a> "Bigfoot Capital of the World", which is apparently responsible for over 300 of California's bigfoot sightings, but the data I pulled from the BFRO doesn't seem to corroborate that.</p>

With legends that originate in Native American culture and documented sightings as early as the 1800s, Washington is responsible much of what the average American understands as quintessentially "Bigfoot". There's a reason there was a bill that would've made Bigfoot Washington's <a href="https://www.issaquahreporter.com/northwest/bigfoot-eludes-state-recognition-yet-again/" target="_">official state cryptid</a>--an imaginative elementary schooler and a bored Republican, yes, but a reason nonetheless.</p>

                        <p>What fascinates me are the ones in the middle of nowhere--out in the arid, unforested steppes. Imagine puttering sleepily down a lonely prarie road, hours from anywhere traditionally understood as bigfoot turf, just to catch sight of one on the horizon, its head the highest point of elevation for miles.</p>
                        <p>But it's clear that sightings generally overlap with parts of Washington that are heavily forested. This certainly tracks given that remote forests are thought to be ideal bigfoot habitat, but they're also ideal habitat for a number of other critters, which sadly brings us to the dilemma of...</p>

                        <p>This is the part where I crush your dreams. What, if not bigfoots, could possibly account for these sightings?</p>
                        <p>The simplest and probably most frequently espoused explanation is that it's a boring, non-cryptid animal. Remember that map of Washington we saw, like, five seconds ago? Well, here's another map from the <a href="http://naturemappingfoundation.org/natmap/maps/wa/mammals/WA_black_bear.html#:~:text=Black%20Bears%20are%20found%20throughout,killed%20or%20relocated%20when%20noticed." target="_">Washington NatureMapping Foundation</a> that shows, in green, the breeding range of black bears in the state.</p>

                            <img id="bearMap" class="center" src="assets/img/greenMap.jpg">
                            <span class="caption text-muted text-center">The black bear breeding range lines up pretty well with Washington's bigfoot sightings.</span>
                        </div>

                        <p>Okay, I know: Correlation does not equal causation. I could show you the distribution of any woodland creature here, regardless of their passing resemblance to Bigfoot, and probably end up with a similar map.</p>
                        <p>Still, of all the living creatures to mistake for bigfoot, isn't a black bear sort of apropos? <a href="https://www.bfro.net/REF/THEORIES/WHF/FahrenbachArticle.htm" target="_">According to the BFRO,</a> a bigfoot stands at somewhere between 6 and 9 feet tall. An average black bear--standing on hind legs, mind you--is 4 to 6 feet tall. They're in the same ballpark is all I'm saying.</p>
                        <p>Alright, but any old bear can <em>stand</em>. What about the people who swear they saw something <em>walking</em> upright? Surely bears can't walk like people do.</p>
                        <p>Behold, and beware:</p>

                        </div>

                        <p>Does this startle you? It startled me. I mean, look. This is unreasonably disconcerting. If I saw that one night on the way back from the outhouse, I'd absolutely pin it as an extant cryptid.</p>

                        <blockquote class="blockquote quoteEdit">"We looked out to see what it was and thought it was a person wearing a hoodie. He looks just like a human from the back."</blockquote>

                        <p>And this isn't some genius circus bear on the lam; this bear, God rest its soul, was missing one of its front paws and learned to walk like this on its own. Tragic injury and amusing adaptation notwithstanding, this is a regular-degular bear. It's possible that someone could come across a standing--even walking--bear in the wild, although the former is probably much more likely.</p>
                        <p>Another interesting coincidence is in <em>when</em> the most bigfoot sightings are reported: Across the board, it's summer. According to the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/grsm/learn/nature/black-bears.htm#:~:text=Bear%20Behavior,the%20coming%20of%20cold%20weather." target="_">National Park Service,</a> black bears are most active during spring and--you guessed it--summer.</p>

It's not damning evidence, but it's reasonable to assume this explains at least some of the sightings, right? And that isn't even factoring in sightings that could've been people or flora.</p>

                        <p>So we've learned that Washington state is far and away the best place to catch sight of a bigfoot--or a black bear, depending on how willing you are to concede that there is no magic in the world.</p>

                        <p>Regardless of whether I believe there's a species of wood ape out there sauntering around in remote forests across America (I don't), it's fascinating to see the lengths people go to to find out for themselves. The passion is truly contagious.</p>
                        <p>I mean, did you look at some of the methodology these guys employ? The BFRO is doing bigfoot math. If someone is willing to genuinely explore the <em>possibility</em> that there might be something to discover, whether it's bigfoot or not, then I can't say it bothers me.</p>
